This repository contains files to replicate my successful attempt
to make projects compile on ArchLinux

=====================================================
BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================================
1. Install dependencies
$ sudo pacman -S assimp glew glm freeglut

2. Apply dif `cw5.diff` to your's `cw\ 5` directory

3. Compile with `make`

=====================================================
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================================

Any glew / freeglut #include must be transformed into absolute `#include <>`
instead of `#include ""` and prepend with `GL/`

Example:
< #include "glew.h>
> #include <GL/glew.h>

Any glm mention must be prepended with `glm/` and also be absolute.

For some reason not all glm extensions will be visible. Search specific file in
/usr/include/glm and import it directly. For example for `glm::eulerAngleY`
I had to add:
#include <glm/gtx/euler_angles.hpp>
